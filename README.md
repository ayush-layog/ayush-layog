**`Problem Solver`**

I'm an indie full-stack developer and multiskilled engineer delving into the quantum world one step at a time. All projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems. While new to the field of quantum computing, I am looking to contribute towards futuristic technologies while gaining relevant experience.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ayush's Journey</h3></summary>

 Being an innately curious child with opening up any machnine I could get my hands on, to building a Van de graff generator, Kelvin water dropper, and Tesla coil as high school projects, to dismantling car and bike engines at SAE workshops at my brother's university, I would like to learn as much as possible for developing 
futuristic technologies. I also started my coding journey as a naive computer science student becoming a full stack software engineer by the time I graduated high school (gold medalist in the International Informatics Olympiad 2010).

As an engineer, my inquisitiveness led me into being involved in multiple teams focussing on structural and thermal analysis of Gokart, Cansat, F1, Mars Rover, UAV and E-Baja vehicle at Delhi Technological University, and Eco vehicle and small rocket design at the University of Strathclyde. I got a glimpse of electronic engineering through the design of a quadcopter for measuring air quality and a CNC machine with CD Drives and rasberry pie, which eventually led me to gain a position in GPM Developers as an automation engineer. My modelling minor projects included working on Python and Matlab, while working independently on C++ for game development and machine learning.

As a physicist, I got involved with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics where I modelled the sky opacity over the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle under different conditions and times using Matlab. Furthermore, as the project head at Physical Research Laboratory, I built the thermal plasma apparatus for the condensation of cometary grains (under room temperature and liquid helium) from scratch, which is then compared to pre-solar grains to get a detailed explanation of the formation of the solar system. Moving on to quantum computing, my thesis project delved into Satellite quantum key distribution, while my study research made me understand quantum computing (learning Cirq and Qiskit) and condensed matter physics with Bose-Einstein condensates. 

Apart from being a nerd, I enjoy dancing, parkour, hiking, and skydiving. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives, and I am trying to create a public profile for the same.

With a sparkle in my eyes, I am coming for the wonderful opportunities to satiate my curiosity.
