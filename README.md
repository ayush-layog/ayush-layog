**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator)`**

I'm an indie full-stack developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube channel "[ForrestKnight][youtube]" to more than 400k subscribers.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ayush's Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.

Being an innately curious child with opening up any machnine I could get my hands on, to building a Van de graff generator, Kelvin water dropper, and Tesla coil as high school projects, to dismantling car and bike engines at SAE workshops at my brother's university, I would like to learn as much as possible for developing 
futuristic technologies. 

With this approach, I moved to earn a bachelor degree in Engineering and Physics simultaneously and subsequently, a master's degree in Advanced Physics (with primary concern in satellite quantum key distribution).

As an engineer, my inquisitiveness led me into being involved in multiple teams focussing on structural and thermal analysis of Gokart, Cansat, F1, Mars Rover, UAV and E-Baja vehicle at Delhi Technological University, and Eco vehicle and small rocket design at the University of Strathclyde. I got a glimpse of electronic engineering through the design of a quadcopter for measuring air quality and a CNC machine with CD Drives and rasberry pie, which eventually led me to gain a position in GPM Developers as an automation engineer. Focussing on  Eventually, I took up projects in Python and MATLAB at my university to gain relevant industry experience and have amassed relevant knowledge through varied work experience. Moreover, with developing skills in C++ and Python, I was a gold medalist in the International Informatics Olympiad 2010. 


As a physicist, I got involved with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics where I studied the sky opacity over the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle under different conditions and times. Furthermore, as the project head at Physical Research Laboratory, I built the thermal plasma apparatus for the condensation of cometary grains from scratch. I have researched thoroughly about quantum computing and looking for opportunities to enhance my arsenal of knowledge.

Apart from being a geek, I enjoy dancing, parkour, hiking, and skydiving. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives.

I would like to devote myself to the immense knowledge of this world and my enthusiasm regards me as a quick learner.
